What a tricky day this was!

It took me a long time to figure out the strategy to solve part 2, and most likely without the tips found on the [Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/1hg38ah/2024_day_17_solutions/) I would never have managed it on my own.

But as usual, let's go through part 1 first: the input consists of a set of **registers** with their initial values, and a **program** of comma-separated instructions, each representing a 3-bit digit (so with values of 0 through 7):

```bash
Register A: 2024
Register B: 0
Register C: 0

Program: 0,3,5,4,3,0
```

The program itself is an alternation of **opcodes** and **operands**. I'm not going to bore you explaining all the [logic in the task](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/17) - long story short, each instruction manipulates the registers or produces output based on specific rules (mainly division, bitwise XOR, pointer manipulation, etc.). Given the initial register values and a program, we execute the program and collect the output from `out` instructions (which is _opcode_ # 5). Finally, we join the output values with commas to produce the final result.

Adding everything together, my function looked like this:

```ts
function runProgram(computer: Computer) {
    let regA = computer.regA ?? 0n;
    let regB = computer.regB ?? 0n;
    let regC = computer.regC ?? 0n;
    const program = computer.program.split(',').map((s) => BigInt(s));

    let output = '';

    const getCombo = (operand: bigint): bigint => {
        switch (operand) {
            case 0n:
            case 1n:
            case 2n:
            case 3n:
                return operand;
            case 4n:
                return regA;
            case 5n:
                return regB;
            case 6n:
                return regC;
            case 7n:
                throw new Error('Invalid operand: 7');
            default:
                throw new Error(`Unknown operand: ${operand}`);
        }
    };

    let pointer = 0;
    while (pointer < program.length) {
        const opCode = program[pointer];
        const operand = program[pointer + 1];

        switch (opCode) {
            case 0n:
                regA = adv(regA, powerOfTwo(getCombo(operand)));
                break;
            case 1n:
                regB = bxl(regB, operand);
                break;
            case 2n:
                regB = bst(getCombo(operand));
                break;
            case 3n:
                if (regA !== 0n) {
                    pointer = Number(operand);
                    continue;
                }
                break;
            case 4n:
                regB = bxc(regB, regC);
                break;
            case 5n:
                output += out(getCombo(operand)) + ',';
                break;
            case 6n:
                regB = bdv(regA, powerOfTwo(getCombo(operand)));
                break;
            case 7n:
                regC = cdv(regA, powerOfTwo(getCombo(operand)!));
                break;
            default:
                throw new Error(`unknown opcode ${opCode}`);
        }
        pointer += 2;
    }
    return output.slice(0, -1); // rm trailing comma
}
```

If part 1 was rather easy - suspiciously easy for a Day 17 challenge ðŸ¤” - part 2 wasâ€¦ uhmâ€¦ tricky to say the least.

The goal was now to find the minimum value to assign to register A so that the program's final output is a copy of the program itself.

As you can imagine, it's probably not the kind of program that can be brute-forced by trying all the possible value until we find the correct oneâ€¦ let's just say my answer was `265652340990875` - a number I won't even try to pronounce. So yeah, gotta be smart about it and find a way to solve this before all my hair turns white.

So, after analysing what our program actually does, as I mentioned with a bit of help from the smart AoC crowd on Reddit, a few things become clear:

\- Register `A` is processed in octals, meaning its value is grouped and operated on in chunks of 3 bits.

\- Registers `B` and `C` are temporary and only hold intermediate results for processing `A`. They do not retain their values between octal blocks.

\- The processing of each octal block depends only on the more significant bits of `A`, making it easier to replicate the output program by analyzing it in reverse.

\- A greedy approach will not work, as there are potential dead ends in the search for valid values of `A`. To handle this, a depth-first search approach can be used to explore possibilities and backtrack when encountering a dead end.

Translating this into code, my solution looked like this:

```ts
function calcMinRegA(computer: Computer) {
    const program = computer.program.split(',').map((num) => BigInt(num));

    // Recursive function to find the smallest value of reg A for a given position in the program
    const findRegA = (value: bigint, current: number): bigint => {
        // If all outputs have been validated, return the current value
        if (current < 0) return value;

        // Iterate over the next 8 possible values of regA for the current octal block
        for (let i = value << 3n; i < (value << 3n) + 8n; i++) {
            // Simulate the program with the current regA value
            const output = runProgram({
                regA: i,
                regB: 0n,
                regC: 0n,
                program: computer.program,
            })
                .split(',')
                .map((s) => BigInt(s));

            // Check if the program output matches the expected value at the current position
            if (output[0] === program[current]) {
                // Recursively validate the next position in reverse
                const finalVal = findRegA(i, current - 1);
                if (finalVal !== -1n) return finalVal; // Return if a valid value is found
            }
        }

        // If no valid value is found for the current octal block, return -1n to backtrack
        return -1n;
    };

    // Start the search with `regA = 0n` and begin validation from the last program position
    return findRegA(0n, program.length - 1);
}
```

So here we are, probably the most deserved star so far ðŸ’«
