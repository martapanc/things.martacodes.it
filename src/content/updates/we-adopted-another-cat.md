Feels strange to post an [update](#we-adopted-a-cat) so soon (has it even been 3 weeks, including [my trip across the ocean](#team-offsite-in-boston)? 🫠), but here we are—another cat has joined the family! 🐈‍⬛🐈‍⬛

Meet Draculino, named for his cutest protruding teeth 🧛. He’s from the same colony as Drusy, a half-abandoned house now under construction, making it unsafe for the cats to stay.

The association caring for them is seeking adopters, and my partner thought Drusy seemed bored while I was away, so… welcome, Lino!
