Time for a quick Easter trip to Rome - my partner needs the French embassy, so we turned it into a mini holiday ðŸ˜Ž

Unfortunately, I ended up catching Covid along the way (lesson learned: always wear a mask when walking in a crowd ðŸ™„), so we had to cut the trip short by a day. Still, it was a lovely time in the city â€” Rome never disappoints!
