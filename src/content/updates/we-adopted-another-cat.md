Feels weird to post this kind of update after such a short amount of time after the [last one](/we-adopted-a-cat) (how long has it been, like 3 weeks? Including one during which I was across the ocean? 🫠), but there it is... today we welcomed another cat to the family! 🐈‍⬛ 🐈‍⬛

His name is Draculino, after his adorable protruding teeth 🧛, and he's from the same cat colony as Drusy: this colony is a half-abandoned house whose owners have suddenly decided to do construction work around it, and clearly it is not safe for the remaining cats to stay nearby with an active construction site. As a result, the association who is looking after the colony decided to try and give the cats for adoption.
Additionally, my partner who spent some time alone with Drusy [while I was in the US](/team-offsite-in-boston) said he looked a bit bored and thought he might enjoy the presence of another cat… so here is: welcome to the family, Lino!

PS: spoiler, technically it was just a stall to support the association while waiting for an adoption... needless to say, we ended up [officially adopting Lino](/officially-adopter) too 😻
