I've wanted to adopt a cat for ages but kept putting it off — either I was in a flat that didn’t allow pets, or travelling too much, or both. Finally, I’m in a stable place, so... welcome home, Drusy! 🐈‍⬛

Drusy is an adorable 8-year-old former colony cat cared for by a local volunteer group. After recovering from a dental infection, they decided he deserved a safe, loving home.

I’m nervous (caring for a living being is no joke!) but so excited to spend years with this cuddly little guy. ❤️
