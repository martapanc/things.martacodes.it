```bash
7 6 4 2 1
1 2 7 8 9
9 7 6 2 1
1 3 2 4 5
8 6 4 4 1
1 3 6 7 9
```

No worries, that's not a representation of `The Matrix` (I mean, it is a matrix, but not _that one_ 😛) - it's just the sample input for today's challenge.

Each row is a list of **levels** which we need to classify as `safe` or `unsafe`. A safe level has the following requirements:

- The levels are either _all increasing_ or _all decreasing_.
- Any two adjacent levels differ by _at least one_ and _at most three_.

So for example:

- `7 6 4 2 1`: _Safe_ because the levels are all decreasing by 1 or 2.
- `1 2 7 8 9`: _Unsafe_ because `2 7` is an increase of 5.
- `1 3 2 4 5`: _Unsafe_ because `1 3` is increasing but `3 2` is decreasing.

In order to evaluate whether the levels are all increasing/decreasing and whether the "jumps" are within the range, I thought about calculating the difference between each two numbers in the list:

```ts
export function getLevelDeltas(level: number[]) {
    const delta = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < level.length - 1; i++) {
        delta[i] = level[i] - level[i + 1];
    }

    return delta;
}
```

For example, in the first row `7 6 4 2 1` we would calculate `[(7 - 6), (6 - 4), (4 - 2), (2 - 1)]` = `[1, 2, 2, 1]`

If the resulting array is _all positive_ or _all negative_ we know that it's respectively fully decreasing or increasing.
Instead, if we had `1 3 2 4` the result would be `[-2, 1, -2]`, which is a mix of positive and negative numbers.

Regarding the range of "jump", having the differences we just need to check that all numbers are 0 < N ≤ 3.

Here's my function:

```ts
function isLevelSafe(level: number[]): boolean {
    let isSafe = true;
    const deltas = getLevelDeltas(level);

    // All non-negative or all non-positive
    if (
        deltas.every((delta) => delta >= 0) ||
        deltas.every((delta) => delta <= 0)
    ) {
        const absDelta = deltas.map((delta) => Math.abs(delta));

        if (absDelta.some((delta) => delta < 1 || delta > 3)) {
            isSafe = false;
        }
    } else {
        isSafe = false;
    }

    return isSafe;
}
```

Part 2 adds a twist - specifically, we're allowed to remove one level from the list: if it becomes safe, we can count it as well.

I decided to extend the original function like this:

```ts
if (isLevelSafe(level)) {
    safeLevelCount++;
} else if (applyTolerance) {
    let isSafeWithTolerance = false;
    for (let i = 0; i < level.length; i++) {
        const newLevel = [...level];
        newLevel.splice(i, 1); // Remove one item at a time and re-check for safety
        if (isLevelSafe(newLevel)) {
            isSafeWithTolerance = true;
            break;
        }
    }
    if (isSafeWithTolerance) {
        safeLevelCount++;
    }
}
```

That's it! Two more stars for me! 🤩
