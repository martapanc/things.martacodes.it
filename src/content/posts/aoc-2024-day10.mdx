Today's task was in retrospect pretty standard; yet, I'm still re-reading the description as I'm writing this, because the difference between part 1 and 2 was fundamental but somehow surprisingly hard to decode (the meme found on the r/adventofcode subreddit I picked for this post's preview is very on point).

We have a grid with numbers from 0 to 9, representing a topographic map:

```
0123
1234
8765
9876
```

As can be guessed, we need to find possible ways to go from 0 to 9 one step at a time, so no movements that are larger than 1 (such as between 0 and 2).
Specifically, part 1 is about finding **trailheads** - meaning the start of a hinking trail - and their scores, that is how many 9s can be reached starting from a 0.

For example a map like this has **one** trailhead with score 2, because starting from the one 0 we can reach two 9s:

```
...0...
...1...
...2...
6543456
7.....7
8.....8
9.....9
```

The goal is to find all possible trailheads and their scores, adding everything to a total that is our puzzle answer.

In order to find the score for a trailhead, I opted for a breadth-first search algorithm: we start from a trailhead (`startCoord`), explore neighboring coordinates one step at a time, and tracks which coordinates can be reached by following height-incrementing paths. For each neighbor, if its height is one greater than the current position, it is added to the queue and marked as visited. If the neighborâ€™s height is 9, itâ€™s added to the `reachableNines` set. The function returns the size of this set, representing how many 9s can be reached from the starting point.

```
function bfsTrailhead(startCoord: Coord): number {
    const queue: Coord[] = [startCoord];
    const visited = new Set<string>;
    const reachableNines = new Set<string>;

    visited.add(startCoord.serialize());

    while (queue.length > 0) {
        const current = queue.shift()!;
        const currHeight = Number.parseInt(grid.get(current.serialize())!);

        for (const neighbor of getNeighborCoords(current)) {
            const neighborKey = neighbor.serialize();
            if (!grid.has(neighborKey) || visited.has(neighborKey)) {
                continue;
            }

            const neighborHeight = Number.parseInt(grid.get(neighborKey)!);
            if (neighborHeight === currHeight + 1) {
                visited.add(neighborKey);
                queue.push(neighbor);

                if (neighborHeight === 9) {
                    reachableNines.add(neighborKey);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    return reachableNines.size;
}
```

The main function is of course a loop through all the cells of the map having a 0, that is the start of a trailhead: the `bfsTrailhead` function computes the score, which is then added to the count:

```
let totalScore = 0;
for (const [coord, value] of grid) {
    if (value === '0') {
        totalScore += bfsTrailhead(coord);
    }
}
return totalScore;
```

Fairly straightforward so far. Part 2, on the other handâ€¦ still not a difficult task, but it still took me some time to understand.

The goal now is to find a trailhead's **rating**: given a trailhead with all its possible peaks, its rating is how many distinct trails can be taken to the summit. Feels like we're solving part 1 again? Maybe, but no, this is a completely different story ðŸ˜›

After some thinking, I thought a useful way to solve this was a depth-first search - the recursive way this time, because why not:

- At the very beginning we check if current height is 9: if yes return 1, as this is a valid path to `9`, so the idea is that this increments the score.
- Initialize `paths = 0` to track valid paths.
- For each neighbor, check if it's in the grid and its height is one greater than the current height.
- If conditions are met, we recursively call `dfsTrailhead` for the neighbor, and add the result to `paths`.
- After exploring all neighbors, return the total valid paths to `9`.

```
function dfsTrailhead(coord: Coord, currentHeight: number): number {
    if (currentHeight === 9) {
        return 1;
    }

    let paths = 0;
    for (const neighbor of getNeighborCoords(coord)) {
        const neighborKey = neighbor.serialize()!;
        if (!grid.has(neighborKey)) {
            continue;
        }

        const neighborHeight = Number.parseInt(grid.get(neighborKey)!);
        if (neighborHeight === currentHeight + 1) {
            paths += dfsTrailhead(neighbor, neighborHeight);
        }
    }

    return paths;
}
```

So yeah, difficult at first glance but feasible.
