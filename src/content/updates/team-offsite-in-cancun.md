New country 'unlocked' for most members of the team — in fact, for this winter 2025 event we chose Mexico!

It has been an amazing week where, between a dish of tacos and a trip to the _playa_ (we can't be productive all the time now, can we 😎), we launched our new website and kicked off an exciting roadmap for the year ahead.

My Spanish learning hasn’t been the most focused or consistent (as the next update will explain 🤦‍♀️), but I still managed to communicate with locals — airport security, hotel staff, and all. So… _no está mal_!
