I wasn’t planning on getting a new car anytime soon… but on January 3rd, some reckless driver totaled my beloved Panda while it was parked on the street, leaving me with no choice 🙄

After a few weeks of searching and sweating — because finding a car with the configuration I wanted on stock was not easy at all — as of today, I am the happy owner of a Toyota Rav4 ✌️

In loving memory of my Panda, I wish it many thousands of kilometres and many adventures together 🙏
