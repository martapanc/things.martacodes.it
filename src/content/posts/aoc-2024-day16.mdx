So many puzzles involving 2d grids this year!

Time for an a-maze-ing Reindeer race:

```aoc
###############
#.......#....E#
#.#.###.#.###.#
#.....#.#...#.#
#.###.#####.#.#
#.#.#.......#.#
#.#.#####.###.#
#...........#.#
###.#.#####.#.#
#...#.....#.#.#
#.#.#.###.#.#.#
#.....#...#.#.#
#.###.#.#.#.#.#
#S..#.....#...#
###############
```

Start from `S` and ending at `E` (duh), the goal here is to optimize on corners, since one movement forward costs 1 point, whereas a rotation costs 1000 points. For example, one of the above maze's best paths has 36 total steps and 7 rotations, reaching a total of 7036 points:

```aoc
###############
#.......#....E#
#.#.###.#.###^#
#.....#.#...#^#
#.###.#####.#^#
#.#.#.......#^#
#.#.#####.###^#
#..>>>>>>>>v#^#
###^#.#####v#^#
#>>^#.....#v#^#
#^#.#.###.#v#^#
#^....#...#v#^#
#^###.#.#.#v#^#
#S..#.....#>>^#
###############
```

For once in my life I managed to be intelligent about addressing part 1 in a way that made solving part 2 almost immediate, so I'm going to anticipate the task for part 2 as well before talking about the code.

Essentially, part 1 is about finding the length / score of the best path; part 2 goes: given the optimal path length, calculate how many unique cells are covered by any of the best paths.

For example, keeping the same grid as above, there's a total of three paths with a score of 7036, and 45 unique cells covering each of them:

```aoc
###############
#.......#....O#
#.#.###.#.###O#
#.....#.#...#O#
#.###.#####.#O#
#.#.#.......#O#
#.#.#####.###O#
#..OOOOOOOOO#O#
###O#O#####O#O#
#OOO#O....#O#O#
#O#O#O###.#O#O#
#OOOOO#...#O#O#
#O###.#.#.#O#O#
#O..#.....#OOO#
###############
```

To solve both problems at once, we can rather simply create a Dijkstra-like pathfinding algorithm that keeps track of the paths found (as opposed to just returning the shortest path whenever one is found):

\- It uses a priority queue to explore paths with the lowest cost first.

\- Movement is allowed in the current direction (low cost) or via turns (higher cost).

\- Tracks visited states and avoids revisiting with higher costs.

\- Stops when the target is reached and all shortest paths are found.

\- Returns the lowest cost and the number of unique positions (seats) in the path.

```ts
function traverse(grid: Grid, start: Coord, end: Coord) {
    const paths = new Set<string>();
    let lowest = Infinity;
    const scores = new Map<string, number>();
    const toVisit = new PriorityQueue<State>((a, b) => a.cost - b.cost);

    toVisit.enqueue({
        position: start,
        direction: Cardinal.EAST,
        cost: 0,
        path: [],
    });

    while (toVisit.size() > 0) {
        const { position, direction, cost, path } = toVisit.dequeue()!;

        const stateKey = `${position.serialize()}:${direction}`;
        if (cost > (scores.get(stateKey) ?? Infinity)) continue;

        scores.set(stateKey, cost);

        if (position.equals(end)) {
            if (cost > lowest) break;

            path.forEach((coord) => paths.add(coord.serialize()));
            lowest = cost;
        }

        const moves: { dir: Cardinal; moveCost: number }[] = [
            { dir: direction, moveCost: 1 },
            { dir: rotate(direction, Direction.RIGHT), moveCost: 1001 },
            { dir: rotate(direction, Direction.LEFT), moveCost: 1001 },
        ];

        for (const { dir, moveCost } of moves) {
            const nextPosition = move(position, dir);
            if (grid.get(nextPosition.serialize()) !== '#') {
                toVisit.enqueue({
                    position: nextPosition,
                    direction: dir,
                    cost: moveCost + cost,
                    path: [...path, position],
                });
            }
        }
    }

    return { lowestScore: lowest, seats: paths.size + 1 };
}
```
