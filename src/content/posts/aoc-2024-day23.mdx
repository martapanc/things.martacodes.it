When people ask why I disappear every December to work on my Advent of Code solution, my answer is simple:

- Itâ€™s incredibly fun.
- I learn so much along the way.

This is especially true for days like this where solving the problem doesnâ€™t require reinventing the wheel, but instead relies on understanding how itâ€™s been solved before.

Today's input consists of a list of connections between computers - essentially a network map:

```
kh-tc
de-co
qp-kh
de-cg
ka-co
yn-aq
de-ta
qp-ub
cg-tb
ta-co
ta-ka
...
```

The goal for now is to find sets of **three inter-connected computers** (i.e. where each computer is connected to the other two). For instance, in the portion of input above we can observe a couple:

```
co,ka,ta
de,ka,ta
```

In particular, the answer is to find a subset of such triplets - specifically, all triplets having at least one computer whose name starts with **t** - but let's worry about this in due time.

So, my first function to solve part 1 is to create an **adjacency list**: for every pair of computers, I want to stores all computers connected to each member of the pair

```
function getAdjacencyList(lines: string[]) {
    const adjacencyList: { [key: string]: Set<string> } = {};
    for (const connection of lines) {
        const [a, b] = connection.split("-");
        if (!adjacencyList[a])
            adjacencyList[a] = new Set();
        if (!adjacencyList[b])
            adjacencyList[b] = new Set();

        adjacencyList[a].add(b);
        adjacencyList[b].add(a);
    }
    return adjacencyList;
}
```

After running this, we get a list where each item is linked to a list of all connected nodes from our input. For example:

```
kh: [tc, qp, ub, ta]
tc: [kh, wh, td, co]
...
```

From our adjacency list, we can proceed to identifying a "triangle" (fundamentally a cycle of three connected nodes) of computers: for each node, the function checks pairs of its neighbors to see if they are also connected, i.e. forming a triangle. It then stores each found triangle as a sorted, comma-separated string in a Set, to ensure we don't consider the same triangle twice.

```
const triangles: Set<string> = new Set();
for (const [node, neighbors] of Object.entries(adjacencyList)) {
    const neighborsArray = Array.from(neighbors);

    for (let i = 0; i < neighborsArray.length; i++) {
        for (let j = i + 1; j < neighborsArray.length; j++) {
            const neighborA = neighborsArray[i];
            const neighborB = neighborsArray[j];

            if (adjacencyList[neighborA].has(neighborB)) {
                const triangle = [node, neighborA, neighborB].sort().join(",");
                triangles.add(triangle);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The last bit is to count all triangles having at least one computer name starting with T, which can be done easily:

```
let trianglesStartingWithT = 0;
[...triangles].forEach((triangle: string) => {
    const split = triangle.split(",")
    if (split.some(s => s.startsWith("t"))) {
        trianglesStartingWithT++;
    }
})

return trianglesStartingWithT;
```

Understandably, to solve part 2 we need to find the **largest set of computers that are all connected** to each other. Sounds trivial, doesn't it? ðŸ˜›

Well, I'm not going to annoy you with the summary of my failed attempts at solving this "my way", because it took way too long, and frankly I don't even remember the process with too much detail at this stage ðŸ˜…

Let's just say, after some research I bumped into the [Bron-Kerbosch algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bron%E2%80%93Kerbosch_algorithm), that seems to be just perfect for what we need here!

Essentially, my input features ~3400 connections, so generating all possible subsets is computationally infeasible because of exponential complexity. However, Bron-Kerbosch comes in handy, since it is designed for finding all **maximal cliques** (that is our largest set of connected computers) within a graph in an efficient way.

If you never heard of this algorithm, you're in good company. Here's the clearest explanation I managed to find of what the various steps are - for the benefit of the reader but especially mine:

> It operates on three sets:
>
> - R (Current Clique): Nodes included in the current clique.
> - P (Candidates): Nodes that can be added to the current clique.
> - X (Excluded): Nodes already considered and excluded from the current clique.
>   At each step:
> - If P and X are empty, R is a maximal clique.
> - A pivot is selected to reduce the search space and optimize performance.
>   Recursive calls refine these sets to explore possible cliques.

After figuring out how to translate this beauty into runnable code, I came up with this:

```
const findLargestParties = (adjacencyList: { [key: string]: Set<string> }) => {
    const parties: string[][] = [];

    const bronKerbosch = (r: Set<string>, p: Set<string>, x: Set<string>) => {
        if (p.size === 0 && x.size === 0) {
            parties.push([...r]);
            return;
        }

        const pivot = p.size > 0 ? [...p][0] : null;
        const pivotNeighbors = pivot ? adjacencyList[pivot] : new Set();

        for (const node of [...p].filter((n) => !pivotNeighbors.has(n))) {
            bronKerbosch(
                new Set([...r, node]),
                new Set([...p].filter((n) => adjacencyList[node].has(n))),
                new Set([...x].filter((n) => adjacencyList[node].has(n))),
            );
            p.delete(node);
            x.add(node);
        }
    }

    bronKerbosch(new Set(), new Set(Object.keys(adjacencyList)), new Set());
    return parties;
}
```

Running this on our adjacency list (computed for part 1), the result is an array of arrays, each containing the cliques of interconnected computers.

```
[
 [de, cg],
 [de, ka, co, ta],
 [cg, yn, aq],
 [aq, vc, wq],
 ...
]
```

Finding the largest list in the group is then easy - I simply used `reduce` for the purpose:

```
const findLargestParty = (parties: string[][]) => {
    return parties.reduce((max, party) => (party.length > max.length ? party : max), []);
}
```

_Et voila_, the computers have been sorted, a new algorithm has been learned, and two brand new, precious stars are now in my bag ðŸ¤©
