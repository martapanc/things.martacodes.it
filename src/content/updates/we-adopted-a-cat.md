I've wanted to adopt a cat for quite some time, but I always had to put it off because either I was living in a rented
flat that did not allow the presence of furry friends, or I was always travelling, or both.

Finally, I reached a living and economic condition suitable for becoming a cat mummy, therefore... welcome home, Drusy! 🐈‍⬛

Drusy is an adorable 8-year-old cat who has lived in a colony and until now has been looked after by a local volunteer association.

He recently underwent an operation on his teeth due to an infection, and despite his full recovery the volunteers thought it would be best for him to end up in a caring and secure home, after several years of living outdoors.

I am both nervous, since caring for another living being is no small responsibility (I guess a little bit like a baby?), and excited about spending the next few years with such a cuddly, adorable little creature 🐱, so I'm looking forward to getting to know him and showing him all the love I'm capable of ❤️
