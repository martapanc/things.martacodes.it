As a New Year's project, I decided to learn Spanish ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸

I've been wanting to do it for a while â€” also because as a native Italian speaker it _should_ be easy â€” and the location of
the next team offsite (no spoilers yet ðŸ‘€) was the perfect excuse to spur me on to finally get into it.

The strategy for now is to follow the lessons in the grammar book I bought, to increase vocabulary with Anki (spaced
repetition worked well while I was learning German), and to start soon to train listening and comprehension e.g. with
videos and podcasts.

Â¡Adelante!
