Big news: the Feline Registry (that's a thing) officially recognized Drusy and Lino as our "children" today!

Their weird "You're my best friend, play with me! 😽 / Marta gave you one extra croquette, I'm gonna murder you! 😾" dynamic continues, but they're starting to tolerate each other's presence, which is the important thing…

Yes, Drusy's bossy personality (apparently it was the same at the colony… boys will be boys 🙄) has emerged and he keeps looking at Lino in a scowl, smacking him when he steals his kennel — but shy, submissive Lino is learning to fight back and assert himself.

Basically, they’re being cats, lol. 😁
