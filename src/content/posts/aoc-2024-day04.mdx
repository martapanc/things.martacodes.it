Ah, word searches! I've been solving them for as long as I can remember, and I pride myself on being pretty good at them 😎
Was I tempted to avoid writing any code and just solve today's puzzle manually? Sure I was! After finding the solution, which in my case was 2524 `XMAS` instances hidden in the input, though, I'm glad I didn't commit to it 😁

Part 1 was as easily understandable as it sounds: we need to find all instances of the word `XMAS` in the grid - horizontally, vertically or diagonally, both forwards and backwards.

After processing the input to map each coordinate to the corresponding character, as I usually do, I decided to structure my solution as follows:

- find all `X` character in the grid;
- continue in each direction to gather the three remaining characters, and verify if, once concatenated, they form the word `XMAS`.

This translated into the following code:

```ts
grid.forEach((value, cell) => {
    if (value === 'X') {
        const all = getAllCandidates(Coord.deserialize(cell), grid);

        const localXmasCount: number = all.filter((s) => s === 'XMAS').length;
        xmasCount += localXmasCount;
    }
});
```

The `getNeighbors` function is simply doing some additions on the Cartesian plane:

```ts
function getNeighborCoords(source: Coord, includeDiagonals: boolean = false) {
    const neighbors = [
        new Coord(source.x, source.y - 1), // N
        new Coord(source.x, source.y + 1), // S
        new Coord(source.x + 1, source.y), // E
        new Coord(source.x - 1, source.y), // W
    ];
    if (includeDiagonals) {
        neighbors.push(...getDiagonalCoords(source));
    }

    return neighbors;
}

function getDiagonalCoords(source: Coord) {
    const coords = []; // Clockwise
    coords.push(new Coord(source.x + 1, source.y - 1)); // NE
    coords.push(new Coord(source.x + 1, source.y + 1)); // SE
    coords.push(new Coord(source.x - 1, source.y + 1)); // SW
    coords.push(new Coord(source.x - 1, source.y - 1)); // NW

    return coords;
}
```

`getAllCandidates` on the other hand returns the coordinates of the three cells surrounding our `X` in each direction.

Might look complicated but it's really not: each `candidateDelta` considers `X` as the (0,0) point and derives the lists of 3 coordinates in each direction.
For example `XMAS` written horizontally left to right would have X=(0,0), M=(1,0), A=(2,0), S=(3,0); if it was right to left, the coordinates would be X=(0,0), M=(-1,0), A=(-2,0), S=(-3,0), and so on.

```ts
function getAllCandidates(cell: Coord, grid: Grid) {
    const candidateDeltas = [
        ['{0,0}', '{1,0}', '{2,0}', '{3,0}'],
        ['{0,0}', '{-1,0}', '{-2,0}', '{-3,0}'],
        ['{0,0}', '{0,1}', '{0,2}', '{0,3}'],
        ['{0,0}', '{0,-1}', '{0,-2}', '{0,-3}'],
        ['{0,0}', '{1,1}', '{2,2}', '{3,3}'],
        ['{0,0}', '{-1,-1}', '{-2,-2}', '{-3,-3}'],
        ['{0,0}', '{1,-1}', '{2,-2}', '{3,-3}'],
        ['{0,0}', '{-1,1}', '{-2,2}', '{-3,3}'],
    ];

    const candidates: string[] = [];
    candidateDeltas.forEach((deltas) => {
        const coords: Coord[] = deltas.map((delta) => {
            return new Coord(cell.x + delta.x, cell.y + delta.y);
        });

        const values = coords
            .filter((c) => grid.has(c))
            .map((c) => grid.get(c)); // Filter the coordinates within the grid

        candidates.push(values.join(''));
    });

    return candidates;
}
```

In part 2 we learn that we misunderstood the original instructions: it's not a XMAS puzzle - it's a X-MAS puzzle 😁

The goal is to find all the two `MAS` arranged as an `X`, basically like this:

```aoc
M.S
.A.
M.S
```

Apart from a stupid bug that made me waste some time, I actually found this part easier than the previous one, if anything for the number of steps involved: I simply had to find all `A` in the grid and check if their diagonal neighbors are some variant of `MMSS`, meaning that they form an X combined with the central A.

```ts
grid.forEach((value, cell) => {
    if (value === 'A') {
        const neighbors = getDiagonalNeighbors(Coord.deserialize(cell), grid);
        const str = neighbors.join('');
        if (
            str === 'MMSS' ||
            str === 'SSMM' ||
            str === 'SMMS' ||
            str === 'MSSM'
        ) {
            xmasCount++;
        }
    }
});
```

It's important that the `M`s and `S`s are consecutive pairs: in the example above, starting from the top-left `M`, we get `MSSM`; if we started from the top-right `S`, it would be instead `SSMM` - essentially we want to exclude `SMSM` and `MSMS`, which would represent a "wrong" type of X-MAS:

```aoc
M.S
.A.
S.M
```

Obviously `MAM` and `SAS` are not quite what we want 🤔

Of course in order to detect the correct instances of `X-MAS` my way, the neighbors list needs to be ordered: clockwise or counter-clockwise doesn't really matter, and neither does the edge we start from - but the list needs to follow any of these orders. Otherwise, if I had, say:

```ts
coords.push(new Coord(source.x - 1, source.y - 1)); // NW
coords.push(new Coord(source.x + 1, source.y - 1)); // NE
coords.push(new Coord(source.x + 1, source.y + 1)); // SE
coords.push(new Coord(source.x - 1, source.y + 1)); // SW
```

so an order like

```bash
1 2
3 4
```

then a case like

```aoc
M.S
.A.
S.M
```

would still be concatenated as `MSSM` and counted as a valid `X-MAS`, while it's clearly not 🤦‍♀️

Lesson learned: after 9 years I can safely say that wrong assumptions are the source of 90% of the bugs I face while doing the AoC challenged.
For now, still, that's two more shiny stars in the bag! 🌠
