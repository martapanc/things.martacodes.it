Big day for us — we bought a flat! 🎉

It’s in a little mountain village near my hometown, Reggio Emilia; it needs some work before we can fully move in (there’s no kitchen yet, for starters), but we’re excited to make it our home 🏠

Getting through all the bureaucracy of buying a house in Italy was no joke, so just signing the papers feels like a win!

(For context, “rogito” is the Italian word for the final deed you sign at the notary.)
