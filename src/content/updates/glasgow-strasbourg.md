A couple of friends is getting married near Glasgow, so this week we fly over to Scotland, and come back by train (yes, it's possible, although I don't recommend it 😵) so that we can work / visit family on the way.

Unfortunately we can't come back via Paris as we normally do thanks to the lovely [landslide](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/europe/article/2023/09/08/france-italy-road-link-damaged-by-landslide-to-reopen-saturday_6129343_143.html) that damaged the train line, we'll take the chance to stop in Strasbourg and have a little holiday 🇫🇷
