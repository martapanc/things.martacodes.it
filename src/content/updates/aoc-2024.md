It's that time of the year again! I'll be doing this year's Advent of Code challenges in TypeScript and posting my solutions
in the [blog](/blog/categories/advent-of-code).

This year's target is 500 stars, so I'm looking forward to helping the elves once again and hopefully reach my shiny reward! ü§©
